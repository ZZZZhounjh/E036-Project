  "Dear Friend,Greetings to you.I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.WEBSITE. http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm. I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.",
  "MR. CHEUNG PUIHANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG. Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinionBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my private box, {che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr Cheung Pui.___________________________________________________________________________Mail envoy??par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke- http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com",

    //               "Dear Friend,Greetings to you.I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.WEBSITE. http:/ews.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm. I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great confidence in me.Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami victims,as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with anybody, even if you decline my request.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours trulyStephen Ayling.",
    //               "MR. CHEUNG PUIHANG SENG BANK LTD.DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,CENTRAL HONG KONG,HONG KONG. Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an urgent business suggestion for you.I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much embarrassment by contacting you through this means for a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, and it is imperative for me to know your opinionBefore the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war  another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to receive his funds. WHAT IS TO BE DONE:I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me via my private box, {che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.Kind Regards,Mr Cheung Pui.___________________________________________________________________________Mail envoy??par le service WebMail du Site PHP-Nuke- http://www.forcetacticalarmy.com",
